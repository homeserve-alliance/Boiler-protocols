ebusd - eBUS daemon
===================

ebusd is a daemon for handling communication with eBUS devices connected to a
2-wire bus system ("energy bus" used by numerous heating systems).

Features
--------

The main features of the daemon are:

 * use USB serial, TCP connected, or UDP device
 * actively send messages to and receive answers from the eBUS
 * passively listen to messages sent on the eBUS
 * regularly poll for messages
 * cache all messages
 * scan for bus participants
 * parse messages to human readable values and vice versa via message configuration files
 * automatically pick message configuration files by scan result from the config web service at ebusd.eu (or alternatively local files)
 * automatically check for updates of daemon and configuration files
 * pick preferred language for translatable message configuration parts
 * grab all messages on the eBUS and provide decoding hints
 * log messages and problems to a log file
 * capture messages or sent/received bytes to a log file as text
 * dump received bytes to binary files for later playback/analysis
 * listen for command line client connections on a dedicated TCP port
 * optionally provide rudimentary HTML interface and allow data retrieval as JSON on HTTP port
 * optionally publish received message data to MQTT topics and vice versa (if authorized)
 * optional user authentication via ACL file for access to certain messages


Installation
------------

Either pick the [latest release package](https://github.com/john30/ebusd/releases/latest)
suitable for your system or build it yourself.

Building ebusd from the source requires the following packages and/or features:
 * autoconf (>=2.63) + automake (>=1.11) or cmake
 * g++ with C++11 support (>=4.8.1)
 * make
 * kernel with pselect or ppoll support
 * glibc with argp support or argp-standalone
 * libmosquitto-dev for MQTT support

To start the build process, run these commands:  
> ./autogen.sh  
> make install  


Documentation

Configuration
-------------

The most important part of each ebusd installation is the message configuration.
Starting with version 3.2, **ebusd by default uses the config web service at ebusd.eu to retrieve
the latest configuration files** that are reflected by the configuration repository (follow the "latest" symlink there):

Docker image
------------

A Docker image using the config web service for retrieving the latest message configuration files is available on the hub.
You can use it like this:  
> docker pull john30/ebusd  
> docker run -it --rm --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -p 8888 john30/ebusd

For more details, see [Docker Readme](https://github.com/john30/ebusd/blob/master/contrib/docker/README.md).
